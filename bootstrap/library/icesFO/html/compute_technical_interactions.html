<h2>Compute a matrix of technical interactions.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Based on landings and catches by species and gear, compute
a matrix of technical interaction values and main gear contributions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
compute_technical_interactions(x, threshByCatch = 5,
  thresholdMainGear = 0.8, thresholdCoCatches = 0.5,
  catchCoverage = 0.95)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a dataframe in the same format as the STECF data.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>threshByCatch</code></td>
<td>
<p>minimum tonnage for a species to be considered
a by catch (default 5)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>thresholdMainGear</code></td>
<td>
<p>a threshold for including gears contributing 
to co-catches, to retain only the gear with the greatest contribution
set this to 1 (default is 0.8)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>thresholdCoCatches</code></td>
<td>
<p>a proportion giving the threshold for when 
we decide that there is co-catches (default 0.5)</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>catchCoverage</code></td>
<td>
<p>the propotion of total catch to cover in the tables
i.e. 0.95 gives a table convering 95% of the total catch (default 0.95)</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with four elements, technical interactions for landings (recapLand)
and catch (recapCatch) and tables of main gears involved in the interactions
based on landings (MainGearsLandings) and catches (MainGearsCatches)
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Technical interaction appears between stocks when they are caught by the same 
gear during a fishing operation. Ideally the technical interaction should then 
be studied at the scale of the fishing operation to prevent artificially creating 
technical interaction between stocks that might only be caught at day/night or in 
different areas/timing of the year. However, often, the finest available information 
is per stock/gear/area/season. Knowing these limitations, the methodology used here 
consists in computing the sum of landings per strata of one species given that a 
second species is also present in the landings of this strata and then dividing 
this number by the total landings of the first species:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>
      T(i,j)=(sum_s L(s,j)*P(s,j)) / (sum_s L(s,i)) *100</i></p>

<p>Where T is the value of the technical interaction, i and j are the two species for 
which the technical interaction is assessed. P is an indicator variable and equals 
0 if the total landings of a species for a for a given strata is less than 5
total landings for that strata and 1 otherwise. L is the landings for a given 
species and strata.
</p>
<p>Strata corresponds to the provided disaggregation of the landings.
